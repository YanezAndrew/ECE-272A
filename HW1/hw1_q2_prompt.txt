Follow the instructions below to handle missing values in the Housing dataset.

Instructions:
1. Import the required libraries:
   - pandas as pd
   - numpy as np
   - KNNImputer from sklearn.impute

2. Read the CSV file from '/autograder/source/housing.csv' into a DataFrame.

3. Select only the numeric columns from the DataFrame.

4. Find a numeric column that contains missing values (NaN).

5. For this column with missing values:
   - Calculate its median value
   - Use KNNImputer with n_neighbors=10 to impute missing values on the numeric columns only
   - Get the imputed value at row 291 (0-based indexing)

6. Create and print a list called answer1 containing exactly three elements in this order:
   - The name of the column with missing values (string)
   - The median value of that column (float)
   - The KNN imputed value at row 291 (float)

The final line of your code must be: print(answer1)
